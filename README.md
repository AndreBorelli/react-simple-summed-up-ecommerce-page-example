## Functionalities:
    
    Beginner Project;
   
    useContext, useEffect, useState and custom Hooks usage;

    Simple example of a e-commerce that makes it possible to enter the name and balance (login), add items dynamically to 
    the cart and when going to the cart page you can only make the purchase if you have available balance, and there is
    also a calculation of value (including interest) in certain payment types. The project also avoids the occurrence 
    of logic problems when using the site that would occur if some precautions were not taken during the development of the code.

    Styled-components.
